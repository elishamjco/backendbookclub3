To run project, first ensure that the requirements are installed. 
<br>Run server in manage.py to view backend at localhost:8000
<br>View Api at localhost:800/api/*insert page here* 
to run front end run npm start and view localhost:3000


In the backend Users can make accounts, book clubs, books, edit and delete books as well as edit and delete clubs. Reviews can now be made, are automatically assigned to a user and do appear!
In the frontend you can view a list of books and clubs that will update if the backend is changed. When you hover over the books a tooltip showing the author should appear.
There also is a button for a dark mode.
Unfortunately this is far from a well working web application; however, this is all i was able to complete.
